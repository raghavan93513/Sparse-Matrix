# Sparse-Matrix
Write an algorithm and the subsequent Python program to check whether the given matrix is sparse or not. A matrix is said to be a “Sparse” if the number  of zero entries  in the matrix,  is greater than or equal to the number  of non-zero entries. Otherwise it is  “Not sparse”. Check for boundary conditions and print 'Invalid input' when not satisfied.
